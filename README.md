## Introduction üß†

Deep learning models often function as **black boxes**, making their decision-making process difficult to understand. **LIME** helps explain model predictions by identifying the most influential image regions. This project uses **InceptionV3** for image classification and applies LIME to visualize explanations for its predictions.

---

## Dataset üìä

The project uses images from standard datasets such as **ImageNet** or custom datasets. Images are preprocessed and fed into the **InceptionV3** model for classification.

---

## Model Architecture üèõÔ∏è

The project leverages the **InceptionV3** architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following key layers:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from images.
- **Batch Normalization**: Improves model stability.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions.
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification.
- **Softmax Layer**: Outputs probability distributions across classes.

The model is pre-trained on **ImageNet** and fine-tuned for specific classification tasks.

## LIME Explanation ‚öîÔ∏è

LIME generates **explainability maps** by perturbing input images and observing the impact on model predictions. The key steps include:
1. **Generating perturbed images** by modifying pixel regions.
2. **Predicting labels** for each perturbed image.
3. **Training an interpretable model** (like a linear model) on the perturbations.
4. **Highlighting influential regions** that contributed to the classification.

---

## Results üìä

Using LIME, we can visualize which parts of an image contributed the most to the final classification. The findings reveal that:

- Some predictions are **strongly influenced** by background pixels.
- Certain misclassifications can be traced back to **ambiguous features**.
- The interpretability of deep learning models can be enhanced significantly.

## Conclusion üèÅ

This project highlights the power of **LIME** in explaining deep learning models' predictions. Understanding which image regions impact classification decisions can help improve trust in AI systems and guide model improvements.
